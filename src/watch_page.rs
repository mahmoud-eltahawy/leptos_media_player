/// A ready-made watch page: [`MediaPlayer`] and [`Playlist`] composed in a
/// YouTube-style layout — player on the left, playlist column on the right,
/// stacking vertically on narrow screens.
///
/// Unlike [`MediaPlayer`] and [`Playlist`] — which take the playlist cursor
/// as a shared `RwSignal<usize>` so they can be wired together however you
/// like — `WatchPage` **owns** its cursor. Pass the playlist and an optional
/// starting index; the page creates the signal internally and hands it to
/// both children.
///
/// `initial_idx` is just that: initial. Changing it after mount has no
/// effect, and the cursor is not exposed upward. If you need to observe or
/// drive the cursor from outside (e.g. persist it, sync it to the URL, or
/// share it with a third component), compose [`MediaPlayer`] and
/// [`Playlist`] yourself with your own signal — see the crate-level docs
/// for an example.
///
/// The playlist is hidden automatically when there is only one item, since
/// an "up next" column with a single entry is noise.
